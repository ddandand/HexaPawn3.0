Hello, welcome to my HexaPawn3.0!

This program is complete with a makefile that will setup the code on its own.
However, it does need to do a few things. This will install the compiler so
the computer can run the code.

If you're on a Linux OS,
 - open the commnad-line interface
    - CTRL + ALT + T
 - type 'sudo apt install build-essential' and press enter

If you're on Windows OS, 
 - open the command prompt
    - Windows key, type 'cmd'. Or Windows_Key + R and type 'cmd'
